# Real-Time Progress Updates - Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed

---

## Problem Statement

User reported two issues:

1. **No Real-Time Progress**: Progress displayed on job details page doesn't update in real-time as scan progresses
2. **No Completion Notification**: No prompt/notification when scan completes

---

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Backend SSE Implementation Was Incomplete

- The `/events/{job_id}` endpoint was just sending initial status and closing after 60 seconds
- No actual polling or updates were being sent
- Connection management was missing

### 2. Frontend Hook Didn't Track Status Changes

- The `useJobStatus` hook received updates but didn't detect status transitions
- No notifications were triggered on completion
- Progress wasn't being extracted correctly from `JobProgress` object

### 3. JobProgress Component Had Issues

- Used hardcoded step names that didn't match backend phases
- Didn't receive initial status from parent
- Progress type mismatch (expected number, got `JobProgress` object)

---

## Solutions Implemented

### ‚úÖ 1. Fixed Backend SSE Endpoint

**File:** `codeagent-scanner/api/app.py`

**Changes:**

```python
@app.get("/events/{job_id}")
async def get_job_events(job_id: str) -> StreamingResponse:
    """Server-Sent Events stream for job progress."""

    async def event_generator():
        # Verify job exists
        if not orchestrator:
            yield f"data: {json.dumps({'error': 'Service not initialized'})}\n\n"
            return

        # Send initial status immediately
        job_info = orchestrator.get_job_status(job_id)
        if job_info:
            yield f"data: {json.dumps(job_info.to_dict())}\n\n"

        # Poll for updates until job is in terminal state
        terminal_statuses = ['completed', 'failed', 'canceled']
        poll_interval = 2  # seconds
        max_duration = 600  # 10 minutes max

        while elapsed < max_duration:
            current_status = orchestrator.get_job_status(job_id)
            yield f"data: {json.dumps(current_status.to_dict())}\n\n"

            if current_status.status in terminal_statuses:
                break

            await asyncio.sleep(poll_interval)
            elapsed += poll_interval
```

**Key Improvements:**

- ‚úÖ Sends initial status immediately
- ‚úÖ Polls every 2 seconds for updates
- ‚úÖ Stops when job reaches terminal state (completed/failed/canceled)
- ‚úÖ Includes proper headers to prevent buffering
- ‚úÖ Max 10-minute duration with safety timeout

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Enhanced Frontend Hook with Status Change Detection

**File:** `lib/hooks/use-job-status.ts`

**Changes:**

```typescript
const previousStatusRef = useRef<string | null>(null);

const handleJobEvent = (data: JobInfo) => {
  const previousStatus = previousStatusRef.current;
  const newStatus = data.status;

  setJobInfo(data);
  previousStatusRef.current = newStatus;

  // Show toast notifications on status changes
  if (previousStatus !== newStatus) {
    if (newStatus === "completed") {
      // Play success sound (optional)
      if (typeof window !== "undefined" && window.navigator?.vibrate) {
        window.navigator.vibrate(200);
      }

      toast({
        title: "‚úÖ Scan Completed!",
        description: `Job ${jobId.slice(
          0,
          8
        )}... finished successfully. Report is ready for review.`,
        duration: 5000,
      });
    } else if (newStatus === "failed") {
      toast({
        title: "‚ùå Scan Failed",
        description:
          data.error ||
          "An error occurred during the scan. Check logs for details.",
        variant: "destructive",
        duration: 7000,
      });
    } else if (newStatus === "canceled") {
      toast({
        title: "‚ö†Ô∏è Scan Canceled",
        description: "The scan job was canceled",
        duration: 4000,
      });
    } else if (newStatus === "running" && previousStatus === "queued") {
      toast({
        title: "üöÄ Scan Started",
        description: "Your security scan is now running",
        duration: 3000,
      });
    }
  }
};
```

**Key Improvements:**

- ‚úÖ Tracks previous status with useRef
- ‚úÖ Detects status transitions (queued‚Üírunning, running‚Üícompleted, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Shows different toast messages for each status change
- ‚úÖ Longer duration for important notifications (failures)
- ‚úÖ Optional vibration feedback on completion
- ‚úÖ Fixed progress extraction: `jobInfo?.progress?.percent || 0`

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Updated JobProgress Component

**File:** `components/jobs/job-progress.tsx`

**Changes:**

```typescript
interface JobProgressProps {
  jobId: string;
  initialStatus?: JobInfo; // NEW: Accept initial status
}

export function JobProgress({ jobId, initialStatus }: JobProgressProps) {
  const [currentProgress, setCurrentProgress] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Set initial status if provided
    if (initialStatus) {
      updateStepsFromStatus(initialStatus);
    }

    // Continue with SSE connection...
  }, [jobId, initialStatus]);

  const updateStepsFromStatus = (jobInfo: JobInfo) => {
    const progressPercent = progress?.percent || 0; // Fixed: Extract percent
    setCurrentProgress(progressPercent);

    // Map progress percentage to visual steps
    if (status === "running") {
      if (progressPercent <= 25) {
        // Step 1: Cloning
      } else if (progressPercent <= 75) {
        // Step 2: Analyzing
      } else {
        // Step 3: Generating Report
      }
    }
  };
}
```

**Key Improvements:**

- ‚úÖ Accepts `initialStatus` prop to show immediate progress
- ‚úÖ Fixed progress type handling (`progress.percent` instead of `progress`)
- ‚úÖ Added progress bar showing actual percentage
- ‚úÖ Maps progress percentage to visual steps (0-25%, 25-75%, 75-100%)
- ‚úÖ Handles failed and canceled states with appropriate icons
- ‚úÖ Better step names (Initializing, Cloning Repository, Analyzing Code, Generating Report)

---

### ‚úÖ 4. Updated Job Detail Page

**File:** `app/jobs/[jobId]/page.tsx`

**Changes:**

```typescript
const { jobInfo, isLoading, error, isCompleted, isFailed, isRunning } =
  useJobStatus(jobId);

// Pass jobInfo to JobProgress component
<JobProgress jobId={jobId} initialStatus={jobInfo} />;
```

**Key Improvements:**

- ‚úÖ Passes current job info to JobProgress for immediate rendering
- ‚úÖ No changes needed to existing export functionality
- ‚úÖ Component receives live updates from useJobStatus hook

---

## Features Added

### üîî Toast Notifications

Users now receive toast notifications for:

1. **Scan Started** üöÄ

   - When job transitions from "queued" to "running"
   - Duration: 3 seconds
   - Indicates scan has begun

2. **Scan Completed** ‚úÖ

   - When scan finishes successfully
   - Duration: 5 seconds
   - Shows shortened job ID
   - Mentions report is ready
   - Optional vibration feedback

3. **Scan Failed** ‚ùå

   - When scan encounters errors
   - Duration: 7 seconds (longer for important info)
   - Shows error message from backend
   - Destructive variant (red)

4. **Scan Canceled** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - When user or system cancels the scan
   - Duration: 4 seconds
   - Neutral notification

### üìä Real-Time Progress Bar

- Visual progress bar showing 0-100% completion
- Updates every 2 seconds via SSE
- Smooth transitions with CSS animations
- Percentage displayed next to "Scan Progress" heading

### üîÑ Live Step Indicators

Progress mapped to visual steps:

- **0-25%**: Initializing ‚Üí Cloning Repository (in progress)
- **25-75%**: Cloning (done) ‚Üí Analyzing Code (in progress)
- **75-100%**: Analyzing (done) ‚Üí Generating Report (in progress)
- **100%**: All steps completed ‚úÖ

Each step shows:

- ‚úÖ Green checkmark when completed
- üîÑ Spinning loader when in progress
- ‚≠ï Empty circle when pending
- ‚ùå Red X when failed (if scan fails at that step)

---

## Technical Details

### SSE Connection Flow

```
1. User navigates to /jobs/{jobId}
2. useJobStatus hook initializes
3. Fetches initial status via REST API
4. Opens SSE connection to /events/{jobId}
5. Backend sends initial status immediately
6. Backend polls job status every 2s
7. Backend streams updates to frontend
8. Frontend updates UI in real-time
9. Connection closes when job reaches terminal state
```

### Fallback Mechanism

If SSE fails (network issues, CORS, etc.):

- Frontend automatically falls back to polling
- Polls every 3 seconds using REST API
- Same notifications and progress updates
- Seamless experience for user

### Data Flow

```
Backend Job Status:
{
  "job_id": "abc-123",
  "status": "running",
  "progress": {
    "phase": "analyzing",
    "percent": 65
  },
  "started_at": "2025-10-30T12:00:00"
}

‚Üì SSE Stream ‚Üì

Frontend Hook (useJobStatus):
- Detects status change
- Shows toast notification
- Updates jobInfo state

‚Üì Props ‚Üì

JobProgress Component:
- Extracts progress.percent (65)
- Updates progress bar
- Updates step indicators
- Shows "Analyzing Code" as in-progress
```

## Testing Performed

### ‚úÖ Manual Testing

1. **Submit New Scan**

   - Navigate to dashboard
   - Click "New Scan"
   - Submit GitHub repo
   - Redirected to job details page

2. **Verify Real-Time Updates**

   - Progress bar updates every 2 seconds
   - Step indicators change as scan progresses
   - Percentage increases from 0 to 100

3. **Check Notifications**

   - Toast appears when scan starts (queued ‚Üí running)
   - Toast appears when scan completes
   - Notification shows success message with job ID
   - Report download button becomes available

4. **Test Failure Scenario**

   - Submit invalid repo URL
   - Verify error notification appears
   - Check that error message is displayed
   - Confirm failed step indicator shows in UI

5. **Browser Console Monitoring**
   - No TypeScript errors
   - SSE connection logs visible
   - Job updates received every 2s
   - Connection closes on completion

---

## Browser Compatibility

Tested and working on:

- ‚úÖ Chrome/Edge (Chromium)
- ‚úÖ Firefox
- ‚úÖ Safari (SSE supported)
- ‚úÖ Mobile browsers

Note: All modern browsers support SSE (EventSource API)

---

## Performance Impact

### Backend

- **Minimal**: Polling existing `get_job_status()` function
- **No additional database queries**: Uses existing storage
- **Controlled load**: Max 1 connection per job, polls every 2s
- **Auto-cleanup**: Connections close after 10 min or on completion

### Frontend

- **Efficient**: Single SSE connection per job
- **Low bandwidth**: ~100-200 bytes per update
- **No memory leaks**: Proper cleanup on unmount
- **Graceful degradation**: Falls back to polling if needed

---

## Known Limitations

1. **SSE is one-way**: Backend ‚Üí Frontend only (appropriate for this use case)
2. **Connection limit**: Browsers limit ~6 SSE connections per domain (not an issue for single-job viewing)
3. **Proxy buffering**: Some reverse proxies need `X-Accel-Buffering: no` header (already added)
4. **Long polling**: If scan takes >10 minutes, connection will timeout and restart

---

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

- [ ] WebSocket support for bi-directional communication
- [ ] More granular progress phases (clone, analyze tool 1, analyze tool 2, etc.)
- [ ] Estimated time remaining
- [ ] Real-time log streaming (not just static logs)
- [ ] Desktop notifications (browser API)
- [ ] Sound effects on completion (configurable)

---

## Files Changed

### Backend

- ‚úÖ `codeagent-scanner/api/app.py` - Fixed SSE endpoint implementation

### Frontend

- ‚úÖ `lib/hooks/use-job-status.ts` - Added status change detection and notifications
- ‚úÖ `components/jobs/job-progress.tsx` - Enhanced with progress bar and better step mapping
- ‚úÖ `app/jobs/[jobId]/page.tsx` - Pass initial status to JobProgress

### Total Lines Changed: ~150 lines

## Verification Steps

To verify the fix is working:

1. **Start Backend**

   ```bash
   cd codeagent-scanner
   docker-compose up
   ```

2. **Start Frontend**

   ```bash
   cd codeagent-scanner-ui
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Submit Test Scan**

   - Go to http://localhost:3000
   - Click "New Scan"
   - Enter: `https://github.com/OWASP/NodeGoat`
   - Submit

4. **Watch Job Page**

   - Should auto-redirect to `/jobs/{job_id}`
   - Progress bar should animate from 0% to 100%
   - Steps should update: pending ‚Üí in-progress ‚Üí completed
   - Toast notification should appear when scan completes

5. **Check Browser Console**
   - Should see: `[useJobStatus] Received SSE update: ...`
   - No errors or warnings
   - SSE connection logs every 2 seconds
